## Sabah Biodiversity Experiment Measurement Protocol, 2024

### Seedling
- All seedlings need a new tag
- Use the 2012 datasheet to determine tag number if tag is missing
- Record species alive/dead

### Measurement Diameter
- Measure diameter at base 1 cm above ground on uphill side
  - If there is damage, buttress or roots measure at the lowest undisturbed point and write that height in the comments (POMD)
- Measure DBH at 130 straight up from uphill side of base on tallest stem
  - If there is damage, buttress or roots measure at the lowest undisturbed point and write that height in the comments (POMB)
- If the stem splits measure DBH on the tallest stem
- If the seedling is slanted measure DBH on the tallest vertical branch
- If the seedling is lying flat on the ground measure DBH on the tallest vertical branch and measure diameter at base where it enters the ground
  - If using calipers measure twice perpendicular at the smallest and fattest point
  - If using DBH tape, measure once but record the number twice
    - Remember to write number in mm not cm so add a zero

### Measurement Height
- Measure from the base on the uphill side of the stem
- If the stem splits measure height on the tallest stem
- If the seedling is slanted measure height on the tallest vertical branch
- If the seedling is lying flat on the ground measure height on the tallest vertical branch

### Comments code
- `Y` is used for bent and split stem seedlings
- `X` is used for flat on the ground seedlings
- `B` is used for seedlings with buttress
- `R` is used for seedlings with ladder roots
- `D` is used if there is damage at diameter at base 
- `DB` is used if there is damage at DBH
- `POMD=` is height of diameter measure
- `POMB=` is height of DBH measure
- `DX` is used if dead standing
- `DY` is used if dead broken
- `DZ` is used if dead missing
