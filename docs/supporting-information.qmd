# Climber cutting

Three of the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment plots included in this study received 
a complete climber cutting treatment as part of a different experiment (plots numbered 5, 11 and 14), 
where all lianas $\ge$ 10 cm in height were cut at the base in 2011 and 2014 [see @obrienPositiveEffectsLiana2019].

Including the climber cutting treatment as a fixed effect in our growth and survival models
did not change our results.

# Species taxonomy

In the main text we use species names which are consistent with prior publications involving the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment. Here, we list the current accepted names for reference. Species names were matched to a static copy of [The World Flora Online (WFO)](http://www.worldfloraonline.org)  v.2024.12 [zenodo.14538251](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14538251) using the function `WFO.match` from the R package {WorldFlora}. The function `WFO.one` was then used to find one unique matching name for each submitted name. using the argument `priority = "Accepted"`, it first limits candidates to accepted names, with a possible second step of eliminating accepted names that are synonyms.

# Estimating missing values of basal diameter

There are 190 missing values of basal diameter in our data (0.73 % of all records for living trees). For these missing values, we estimated basal diameter from diameter at breast height using a known allometric equation [@cushmanImprovingEstimatesBiomass2014];

$$
d_{h2} = \frac{D_{h1}}{exp(b_1 h1 - h2)}
$$

where $d_{h2}$ is the estimated diameter (mm) at height $h_2$ (m),
$D_{h1}$ is the known diameter (mm) at height $h_1$ (m), 
and $b_1$ is a taper parameter.

We chose the value for our taper parameter $b_1 = 3.91$ by 
optimising on trees where we had diameter measurements both at the base and at 
breast height, to find the value which gave the lowest Root Mean Squared Error.

![In (a), estimated values of basal diameter are plotted against their true values. The red line indicates where the estimate is equal to the true value. (b) Shows the distribution of the error around zero (red line).](../code/notebooks/figures/2025-07-28_estimate-basal-diameter/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){#fig-est-basal width=400}

# Prior choice

We set weakly informative priors on each of the three parameters describing growth (equation 1) for the population-level effect of forest type. We left the predictor variables on their original scale, since the parameters have meaningful values. We used a log-normal prior for A, maximum size, with  = 6,  = 1. The world’s tallest tropical tree, found at our primary forest study site in Danum Valley, has a DBH of 212 cm (Shorea faguetiana) (Shenkin et al., 2019). We expect a right-skewed distribution of adult size, with few very large individuals and a lower limit of 0 mm. The Student’s-t distribution is generally recommended for weakly informative priors as it has heavier tails than a normal distribution and hence is more robust to outliers (Ghosh et al., 2017). We used Student’s-t priors with degrees of freedom set to five for the remaining population-level priors. The prior for k, the growth rate coefficient, was set with  = 0,  = 0.5 and a lower bound of 0, since the basal diameter of dipterocarp seedlings in other locations grow at a rate of X-X (cite). Finally, the prior for delay, the time at inflection of the curve in years, was set with  = 0,  = 5. Since seedlings were germinated in the nursery no more than X months before transplanting to the forest, delay cannot be less than -X years and is very unlikely to be greater than 10 years. For the group-level effects of species and seedling ID we used the default priors provided by the R package {brms}: a Student-t prior with three degrees of freedom,  = 0 and  = 2.5.
