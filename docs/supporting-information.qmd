# Climber cutting

Three of the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment plots included in this study received 
a complete climber cutting treatment as part of a different experiment (plots numbered 5, 11 and 14), 
where all lianas $\ge$ 10 cm in height were cut at the base in 2011 and 2014 [see @obrienPositiveEffectsLiana2019].

Including the climber cutting treatment as a fixed effect in our growth and survival models
did not change our results.

# Species taxonomy

In the main text we use species names which are consistent with prior publications involving the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment. Here, we list the current accepted names for reference. Species names were matched to a static copy of [The World Flora Online (WFO)](http://www.worldfloraonline.org)  v.2024.12 [zenodo.14538251](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14538251) using the function `WFO.match` from the R package {WorldFlora}. The function `WFO.one` was then used to find one unique matching name for each submitted name. using the argument `priority = "Accepted"`, it first limits candidates to accepted names, with a possible second step of eliminating accepted names that are synonyms.

# Survival analysis of logged forest seedlings in their first census

57% of all individuals were never recorded as alive (5,868 out of 10,272) 
i.e., they died in the period between planting and their first census. 
This occurs exclusively in the logged forest 
since unlike in the old-growth forest, 
diameter measurements were not taken at the time of planting. 

We excluded these individuals from the main analysis since they 
lack data both on size and exact age, 
hence the seedlings cannot be directly compared.
For the first cohort of seedlings planted into the logged forest, 
between 18 and 20 months elapsed between planting and censusing, 
in that time 70% of seedlings died (5,034 out of 7,222).
For the second cohort (replacing dead seedlings from cohort one), 
between 7 and 28 months elapsed between planting and censusing, and
30% died (834 out of 2,746).

Nevertheless, this data might provide some insight on which species are more likely to survive over these time periods, 
and we present a simple analysis here.

Survival of seedlings from cohort one and two were assessed in separate models with identical formulae.
We fit the models in the `R` package `brms` 
with a Bernoulli response distribution, 
where zero indicated the seedling was dead in it's first census and one indicated it was alive. 
The predictor was a fixed effect of species. 
We use a regularising prior of `normal(0, 2)`, a common choice for Bernoulli models. 
Results are presented in @fig-cens1-surv and @fig-cens1-corrsurv.

# Estimating missing values of basal diameter

There are 190 missing values of basal diameter in our data (0.73% of all records for living trees). For these missing values, we estimated basal diameter from diameter at breast height using a known allometric equation [@cushmanImprovingEstimatesBiomass2014];

$$
d_{h2} = \frac{D_{h1}}{exp(b_1 h1 - h2)}
$$

where $d_{h2}$ is the estimated diameter (mm) at height $h_2$ (m),
$D_{h1}$ is the known diameter (mm) at height $h_1$ (m), 
and $b_1$ is a taper parameter.

We chose the value for our taper parameter $b_1 = 3.91$ by 
optimising on trees where we had diameter measurements both at the base and at 
breast height, to find the value which gave the lowest Root Mean Squared Error.

![In (a), estimated values of basal diameter are plotted against their true values. The red line indicates where the estimate is equal to the true value. (b) Shows the distribution of the error around zero (red line).](../code/notebooks/figures/2025-07-28_estimate-basal-diameter/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){#fig-est-basal width=400}
